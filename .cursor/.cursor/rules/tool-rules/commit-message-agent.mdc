# Commit Message Formatting and Content Rule

## Critical Rules

- Every commit message MUST begin with the ticket number in square brackets, matching the ticket in the branch name (e.g., [ARTEMIS-4978]).
- The ticket number MUST be extracted from the branch name if present.
- Commit messages MUST be direct, descriptive, and focused on what was changedâ€”no fluff, no justifications like "for improved performance" or "for enhanced clarity."
- Do NOT include explanations, motivations, or meta-commentary in the commit message body.
- If the branch does not contain a ticket number, this rule does not apply (but you should probably rethink your workflow).
